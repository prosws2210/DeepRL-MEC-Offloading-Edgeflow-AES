# Deep Reinforcement Learning for Online Offloading in MEC Networks

## üìå Project Overview
This project implements **Deep Reinforcement Learning-based Online Offloading (DROO)** for Mobile-Edge Computing (MEC) networks.  
It addresses the complex problem of **real-time binary offloading** in wireless powered MEC systems with multiple users competing for shared resources.  
By leveraging DRL, the system achieves **low latency**, **energy efficiency**, and **near-optimal performance** without relying on computationally expensive optimization methods.
