# Deep Reinforcement Learning for Online Offloading in MEC Networks

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements **Deep Reinforcement Learning-based Online Offloading (DROO)** for **Mobile-Edge Computing (MEC)** networks.  
It addresses the complex problem of **real-time binary offloading decisions** in wireless-powered MEC systems where multiple users compete for shared computational resources.

The system uses a **Memory-Augmented Deep Neural Network (MemoryDNN)** agent that learns optimal offloading policies through continuous interaction with a simulated MEC environment. By leveraging deep reinforcement learning, the system achieves **near-optimal performance** with **ultra-low decision latency** compared to traditional optimization methods.

## 🎯 Core Problem Statement
In Mobile Edge Computing networks, wireless devices face a critical decision at each time frame:

- **Local Processing**: Execute computational tasks on the device (energy-intensive but immediate)  
- **MEC Offloading**: Send tasks to edge servers (network-dependent but computationally efficient)

The challenge is to make these **binary offloading decisions in real-time** while considering:

- Dynamic wireless channel conditions  
- Multiple users competing for MEC resources  
- Energy harvesting constraints in wireless-powered systems  
- Varying computational loads and priorities  

Traditional optimization approaches require **seconds to minutes** for decision-making, making them impractical for real-time applications.
