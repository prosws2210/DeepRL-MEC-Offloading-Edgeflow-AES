# # **01: Exploratory Data Analysis for the DROO Project**
# 
# ### **Overall Project Goal**
# 
# The ultimate goal of the **Deep Reinforcement Learning for Online Offloading** project is to train an intelligent agent that makes real-time offloading decisions for multiple wireless devices connected to a Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) server. For every computation task, the agent must decide whether a device should **process it locally** or **offload it to the server**, aiming to maximize the overall network performance (the weighted sum computation rate).
# 
# ---
# 
# ### **The Purpose of This Notebook: Building the Foundation**
# 
# This notebook is the crucial first step in our project: **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**.
# 
# Before we can build an intelligent agent, we must first deeply understand the problem it is trying to solve. Think of this as a detective studying the crime scene before identifying a suspect. We will load the project's data, verify its integrity, and create a series of visualizations to answer key questions about the environment and the optimal behavior within it.
# 
# > **We are not training any models here.** We are simply understanding the ground we're standing on to ensure we build our DRL agent on a solid, data-driven foundation.
# 
# ---
# 
# ### **The Dataset**
# 
# The dataset (`data_10.mat`) is unique because it contains not just raw environmental data, but also the **pre-calculated optimal solutions** found by a traditional, non-real-time optimization algorithm. This "perfect" data serves as our **ground truth** or **"oracle" benchmark**. Our DRL agent will later attempt to learn a policy that mimics this optimal behavior in real-time.
# 
# Our key data components include:
# -   `input_h`: The **state** of the environment (wireless channel gains for each user).
# -   `output_mode`: The **optimal action** (0 for Local, 1 for Offload).
# -   `output_obj`: The **optimal outcome** (the maximum possible computation rate).
# 
# ### **Notebook Workflow**
# 
# This analysis will follow a structured narrative to build our understanding layer by layer:
# 1.  **Setup and High-Level Overview:** Load the data into a Pandas DataFrame and get a full statistical summary.
# 2.  **Analyzing the Environment:** A deep dive into the wireless channel gains to understand their volatility and characteristics.
# 3.  **Understanding the "Oracle":** A detailed look at the optimal decisions and performance outcomes.
# 4.  **Connecting Inputs to Outputs:** The core of our analysis, where we uncover the direct relationships between channel quality and optimal decisions.
# 5.  **Conclusion & Next Steps:** Summarize our findings into actionable insights that will directly inform the design of our DRL agent.

# ### **Objective**
# The purpose of this notebook is to load, inspect, and visualize the optimal offloading dataset for the DROO project. The goal is to understand the underlying relationships between wireless conditions (inputs) and optimal decisions (outputs). These insights will be crucial for guiding the design, training, and evaluation of our Deep Reinforcement Learning agent.
# 
# ### **Libraries Used**
# We will be using the following Python libraries for our analysis:
# - **scipy:** To load the `.mat` data file.
# - **numpy:** For numerical operations.
# - **pandas:** For creating and managing a structured DataFrame, which is ideal for analysis.
# - **matplotlib & seaborn:** For creating high-quality visualizations.

# ### **Cell 6: Distribution of Channel Gains per User**
# 
# **Purpose:** To understand and compare the typical signal quality for different users. Are some users consistently in better or worse environments?
# 
# **Action:** We will plot the Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) for the channel gains of a few representative users. A KDE plot is a smoothed version of a histogram that helps visualize the probability density of a variable. We'll select users who showed very different offloading behaviors in our initial analysis (e.g., high, medium, and low frequency offloaders).

# %%
# ===================================================================
# Cell 6: Code for Channel Gain Distribution Plot
# ===================================================================

# --- Select Representative Users ---
# From our previous notebook, we know User 0 offloads frequently, User 8 rarely, and User 4 is somewhere in the middle. This makes them good candidates for comparison.
users_to_plot = ['h_user_0', 'h_user_4', 'h_user_8']

# --- Create the Plot ---
plt.figure(figsize=(14, 8))
sns.kdeplot(data=df[users_to_plot], fill=True, alpha=0.5, linewidth=2)

# --- Add Titles and Labels ---
plt.title('Distribution of Wireless Channel Gains for Select Users', fontsize=18, fontweight='bold')
plt.xlabel('Channel Gain (h)', fontsize=14)
plt.ylabel('Density', fontsize=14)
plt.legend(title='User', labels=['User 0 (High Offloader)', 'User 4 (Medium Offloader)', 'User 8 (Low Offloader)'])
plt.grid(True, which='both', linestyle='--', linewidth=0.5)

plt.show()

# %% [markdown]
# **Insight:** The plot clearly shows that different users experience vastly different channel conditions. The distribution for **User 0** is shifted to the right, indicating a higher probability of having stronger channel gains. Conversely, the distribution for **User 8** is heavily skewed towards the left, confirming consistently poor signal quality. This directly supports the idea that a personalized policy is necessary.

# %% [markdown]
# ### **Cell 7: Time-Series Fluctuation of Channel Gains**
# 
# **Purpose:** To visualize how dynamically the wireless environment changes from one moment to the next.
# 
# **Action:** We will plot the channel gains for the same selected users over the first 250 time slots. This line chart will reveal the volatility and temporal nature of the signal quality.

# %%
# ===================================================================
# Cell 7: Code for Time-Series Fluctuation Plot
# ===================================================================

# --- Configuration ---
samples_to_plot = 250
users_to_plot = ['h_user_0', 'h_user_1', 'h_user_8'] # User 1 is also a high offloader

# --- Create the Plot ---
plt.figure(figsize=(16, 8))
plt.plot(df.index[:samples_to_plot], df[users_to_plot[0]][:samples_to_plot], label='User 0 (High Offloader)', color='royalblue', linewidth=2)
plt.plot(df.index[:samples_to_plot], df[users_to_plot[1]][:samples_to_plot], label='User 1 (High Offloader)', color='green', linewidth=2, linestyle='--')
plt.plot(df.index[:samples_to_plot], df[users_to_plot[2]][:samples_to_plot], label='User 8 (Low Offloader)', color='red', linewidth=2, alpha=0.7)

# --- Add Titles and Labels ---
plt.title(f'Channel Gain Fluctuation Over First {samples_to_plot} Time Slots', fontsize=18, fontweight='bold')
plt.xlabel('Time Slot (Sample Index)', fontsize=14)
plt.ylabel('Channel Gain (h)', fontsize=14)
plt.legend(fontsize=12)
plt.grid(True, which='both', linestyle='--', linewidth=0.5)
plt.xlim(0, samples_to_plot)

plt.show()

# %% [markdown]
# **Insight:** This graph powerfully demonstrates the high volatility of the wireless channel. The gains for all users fluctuate rapidly and unpredictably. A static offloading strategy would be ineffective in such an environment. This visual evidence strongly justifies the need for an online, adaptive agent that can react to these changes in real-time.

# %% [markdown]
# ### **Cell 8: Correlation of Channel Gains Between Users**
# 
# **Purpose:** To determine if users' channel conditions are independent or if they are influenced by common environmental factors.
# 
# **Action:** We will create a correlation matrix for the channel gain columns (`h_user_0` through `h_user_9`) and visualize it as a heatmap.

# %%
# ===================================================================
# Cell 8: Code for Channel Gain Correlation Heatmap
# ===================================================================

# --- Select only the channel gain columns ---
h_cols = [f'h_user_{i}' for i in range(num_users)]
channel_gain_df = df[h_cols]

# --- Calculate the correlation matrix ---
correlation_matrix = channel_gain_df.corr()

# --- Create the Plot ---
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 10))
sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, 
            annot=False, # Set to True for a smaller number of users, but False is cleaner for 10+
            cmap='coolwarm', 
            linewidths=.5)

# --- Add Titles and Labels ---
plt.title('Correlation Matrix of Channel Gains Between Users', fontsize=18, fontweight='bold')
plt.xlabel('User ID', fontsize=14)
plt.ylabel('User ID', fontsize=14)

plt.show()

# %% [markdown]
# **Insight:** The heatmap shows a diagonal line of perfect correlation (each user with itself), which is expected. The off-diagonal values are all very close to zero (indicated by the neutral color). This implies that the channel gains for different users are **largely independent and uncorrelated**. An environmental factor affecting one user does not necessarily affect others. This is a key finding for the DRL agent, as it suggests that the agent must consider each user's state individually rather than relying on a single, system-wide quality indicator.

# 
# ### **Cell 9: Overall Offloading Ratio**
# 
# **Purpose:** To get a bird's-eye view of the optimal strategy. Is the system generally biased towards offloading tasks or processing them locally?
# 
# **Action:** We will calculate the total number of "Offload" (`1`) vs. "Local" (`0`) decisions across all users and time slots and visualize the ratio using a pie chart.

# %%
# ===================================================================
# Cell 9: Code for Overall Offloading Ratio Pie Chart
# ===================================================================

# --- Select all mode columns ---
mode_cols = [f'mode_user_{i}' for i in range(num_users)]
mode_data = df[mode_cols]

# --- Calculate Totals ---
total_decisions = mode_data.size
total_offloads = mode_data.sum().sum()
total_locals = total_decisions - total_offloads

# --- Data for Pie Chart ---
labels = ['Local Processing', 'Offloading to Server']
sizes = [total_locals, total_offloads]
colors = ['#ff9999','#66b3ff']
explode = (0.1, 0)  # explode the 'Local Processing' slice slightly

# --- Create the Plot ---
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
plt.pie(sizes, explode=explode, labels=labels, colors=colors, autopct='%1.1f%%',
        shadow=True, startangle=90, textprops={'fontsize': 14, 'fontweight': 'bold'})

# --- Add Title ---
plt.title('Overall Ratio of Optimal Decisions', fontsize=18, fontweight='bold')
plt.axis('equal')  # Equal aspect ratio ensures that pie is drawn as a circle.

plt.show()

# %% [markdown]
# **Insight:** The pie chart reveals that, under an optimal policy, tasks are processed locally the majority of the time (~70%). Offloading, while crucial, is the less frequent action. This suggests that the conditions required for beneficial offloading (e.g., strong channel gain) are not always met, and the default behavior is to rely on local computation.

# %% [markdown]
# ### **Cell 10: Offloading Frequency Per User**
# 
# **Purpose:** To break down the offloading strategy for each individual user. This helps us understand the user-specific nature of the optimal policy.
# 
# **Action:** We will calculate the percentage of time each user offloads its tasks and display this comparison in a bar chart. This is a more detailed view of the data shown in the previous pie chart.

# %%
# ===================================================================
# Cell 10: Code for Offloading Frequency Bar Chart
# ===================================================================

# --- Calculate the percentage of time each user offloads ---
offloading_frequency = df[mode_cols].mean() * 100

# Rename the index for better plotting labels
offloading_frequency.index = [f'User {i}' for i in range(num_users)]

# --- Create the Plot ---
plt.figure(figsize=(16, 8))
barplot = sns.barplot(x=offloading_frequency.index, y=offloading_frequency.values, palette='viridis')

# --- Add Titles, Labels, and Annotations ---
plt.title('Optimal Offloading Frequency per User', fontsize=18, fontweight='bold')
plt.xlabel('User ID', fontsize=14)
plt.ylabel('Offloading Frequency (%)', fontsize=14)
plt.ylim(0, 100) # Set y-axis to be from 0 to 100%
plt.xticks(rotation=0)

# Add percentage labels on top of each bar
for p in barplot.patches:
    barplot.annotate(format(p.get_height(), '.1f') + '%', 
                     (p.get_x() + p.get_width() / 2., p.get_height()), 
                     ha = 'center', va = 'center', 
                     xytext = (0, 9), 
                     textcoords = 'offset points',
                     fontweight='bold')

plt.show()

# %% [markdown]
# **Insight:** This chart confirms the highly personalized nature of the optimal policy. **Users 0 and 1** are frequent offloaders (>60%), likely due to favorable conditions. In stark contrast, **Users 8 and 9** are infrequent offloaders (<10%), suggesting local processing is almost always the better choice for them. Our DRL agent must learn to tailor its decisions to each specific user.

# %% [markdown]
# ### **Cell 11: Distribution of Optimal Performance (Q_star)**
# 
# **Purpose:** To understand the range, central tendency, and distribution of the target performance metric our agent will try to maximize.
# 
# **Action:** We will create a combined histogram and box plot for the `Q_optimal` column. The histogram shows the frequency of different performance scores, while the box plot provides a clear summary of the statistical distribution (median, quartiles, and outliers).

# %%
# ===================================================================
# Cell 11: Code for Q_optimal Histogram and Box Plot
# ===================================================================

# --- Create the Figure with two subplots (shared x-axis) ---
fig, (ax_box, ax_hist) = plt.subplots(2, sharex=True, 
                                     gridspec_kw={"height_ratios": (.15, .85)}, 
                                     figsize=(14, 8))

# --- Box Plot (Top) ---
sns.boxplot(x=df['Q_optimal'], ax=ax_box, color='mediumseagreen')
ax_box.set_xlabel('')
ax_box.set_title('Distribution of Optimal Computation Rate (Q*)', fontsize=18, fontweight='bold')

# --- Histogram (Bottom) ---
sns.histplot(data=df, x='Q_optimal', ax=ax_hist, kde=True, bins=50, color='royalblue')
ax_hist.set_xlabel('Weighted Sum Computation Rate', fontsize=14)
ax_hist.set_ylabel('Frequency', fontsize=14)

# Add a vertical line for the mean
mean_q = df['Q_optimal'].mean()
ax_hist.axvline(mean_q, color='red', linestyle='--', linewidth=2, label=f'Mean = {mean_q:,.2f}')
ax_hist.legend()

plt.show()

# --- Print Key Statistics ---
print(f"\n--- Statistics for Optimal Computation Rate (Q*) ---")
print(f"  - Average: {np.mean(df['Q_optimal']):,.2f}")
print(f"  - Minimum: {np.min(df['Q_optimal']):,.2f}")
print(f"  - Maximum: {np.max(df['Q_optimal']):,.2f}")
print(f"  - Median:  {np.median(df['Q_optimal']):,.2f}")

# %% [markdown]
# **Insight:** The distribution is right-skewed, meaning most optimal outcomes are clustered between 2M and 4M, but there is a long tail of rare, very high-performance events. The average performance is approximately **3.18 million**. This value will be a critical benchmark for evaluating our DRL agent's performance.

# %% [markdown]
# ### **Cell 12: Analysis of Energy Broadcasting Time (a_time)**
# 
# **Purpose:** To analyze how the central server allocates its energy broadcasting resource (`a_time`) under the optimal policy.
# 
# **Action:** We will plot a histogram of the `a_time` column to see its distribution.

# %%
# ===================================================================
# Cell 12: Code for Energy Broadcasting Time Histogram
# ===================================================================

plt.figure(figsize=(14, 7))
sns.histplot(data=df, x='a_time', kde=True, bins=50, color='darkorange')

# --- Add Titles and Labels ---
plt.title('Distribution of Energy Broadcasting Time (a_time)', fontsize=18, fontweight='bold')
plt.xlabel('Energy Broadcasting Time', fontsize=14)
plt.ylabel('Frequency', fontsize=14)

# Add a vertical line for the mean
mean_a = df['a_time'].mean()
plt.axvline(mean_a, color='black', linestyle='--', linewidth=2, label=f'Mean = {mean_a:.2f}')
plt.legend()

plt.show()

# %% [markdown]
# **Insight:** The distribution of `a_time` is somewhat bell-shaped but slightly right-skewed. It appears the optimal policy frequently allocates a broadcasting time between 0.4 and 0.6. This suggests that the server must balance between providing energy for local tasks and reserving time for offloading.

# %% [markdown]
# ### **Cell 13: Analysis of Task Offloading Times (tau)**
# 
# **Purpose:** To understand and compare how long tasks take to offload for different users. This duration is a critical factor in the offloading decision.
# 
# **Action:** We will use box plots to visualize the distribution of offloading times (`tau`) for each user. We will only consider time slots where offloading actually occurred (i.e., `mode=1`), as `tau` is zero otherwise.

# %%
# ===================================================================
# Cell 13: Code for Task Offloading Time Box Plots
# ===================================================================

# --- Prepare data: we only care about tau when mode=1 ---
tau_cols = [f'tau_user_{i}' for i in range(num_users)]
mode_cols = [f'mode_user_{i}' for i in range(num_users)]

# Create a temporary copy to avoid modifying the original DataFrame
tau_when_offloading = df[tau_cols].copy()

# Where the mode is 0 (local), set the corresponding tau to NaN using .loc[]
for i in range(num_users):
    mask = df[f'mode_user_{i}'] == 0
    tau_when_offloading.loc[mask, f'tau_user_{i}'] = np.nan

# --- Create the Plot ---
plt.figure(figsize=(18, 9))
sns.boxplot(data=tau_when_offloading, palette='coolwarm')

# --- Add Titles and Labels ---
plt.title('Distribution of Offloading Times (tau) per User (when offloading)', fontsize=18, fontweight='bold')
plt.xlabel('User ID', fontsize=14)
plt.ylabel('Task Offloading Time', fontsize=14)
plt.xticks(ticks=range(num_users), labels=[f'User {i}' for i in range(num_users)], rotation=0)

plt.show()

# %% [markdown]
# **Insight:** The box plots show significant variation in offloading times across users. For instance, **User 1**, a frequent offloader, often experiences longer offloading durations, suggesting it might be offloading larger tasks. **Users 8 and 9**, who rarely offload, have very short offloading times when they do. This could mean they only offload very small tasks or when their channel conditions are exceptionally (and briefly) good.

# 
# **Purpose:** To visually prove the core hypothesis of this project: that the optimal decision to offload is directly driven by the quality of the wireless channel.
# 
# **Action:** We will create a series of box plots. For each user, we will compare the distribution of their channel gains when the optimal decision was "Local" (`mode=0`) versus "Offload" (`mode=1`).```

# %% [markdown]
# **Insight:** This set of plots provides the clearest validation of our core hypothesis. For every single user, the box plot for **'Offload'** decisions is significantly higher than for **'Local'** decisions. This proves that the optimal policy consistently chooses to offload only when the wireless channel gain is strong. This is precisely the behavior our DRL agent needs to learn.

# %% [markdown]
# ### **Cell 15: Time-Series Overlay for a Single User**
# 
# **Purpose:** To provide a more intuitive, time-based view of the relationship between channel gain and offloading decisions for a single, representative user.

# **Insight:** The visualization makes the connection immediate and undeniable. The red 'Offload Decision' markers appear almost exclusively at the **peaks** of the blue 'Channel Gain' line. This provides a dynamic view of the behavior shown in the box plots: the oracle makes the decision to offload precisely when the opportunity (a strong signal) arises.

# ### **Cell 16: System Performance vs. Number of Offloading Users**
# 
# **Purpose:** To understand the system-level relationship between the number of users offloading and the overall network performance.
# 
# **Action:** We will create a scatter plot with a regression line. The x-axis will be the number of users offloading in a time slot, and the y-axis will be the optimal computation rate (`Q_optimal`).

# %% [markdown]
# **Insight:** There is a clear and strong **positive linear relationship**. As the number of users offloading increases, the overall system performance (`Q*`) tends to increase significantly. However, there is still high variance. For example, when 4 users offload, the performance can range from under 2M to over 6M. This suggests that *who* offloads (i.e., those with the best channels) is just as important as *how many* offload.

# ### **Cell 17: System Performance vs. Average System Channel Quality**
# 
# **Purpose:** To investigate how the overall quality of the wireless environment across all users impacts the total system performance.

# %% [markdown]
# **Insight:** Similar to the previous plot, this visualization shows a strong **positive correlation**. When the average channel quality across the entire system is high, the potential for achieving a high computation rate is also much greater. This reinforces that the agent's ability to perceive and react to the overall system state is critical for maximizing performance.

# 
# **Action:** We will compute the correlation matrix for a selection of important columns (channel gains, offloading decisions, resource allocation times, and the final performance metric) and visualize it using a seaborn heatmap. This will serve as a quantitative confirmation of the patterns we observed visually.

# **Insight:** The heatmap numerically confirms our previous observations:
# 1.  **Strong Positive Correlation:** For each user, their channel gain (`h_user_x`) is strongly and positively correlated with their decision to offload (`mode_user_x`). For example, `h_user_0` and `mode_user_0` have a correlation of `+0.79`.
# 2.  **Performance Drivers:** The optimal performance (`Q_optimal`) is most strongly correlated with the number of offloading users (`+0.85`) and the average system-wide channel gain (`+0.81`).
# 3.  **User Independence:** The channel gains between different users show very low correlation, confirming they are largely independent variables.

# %% [markdown]
# ### **Cell 19: Summary of Key Findings**
# 
# **Purpose:** To clearly and concisely list the main takeaways from our entire exploratory data analysis.
# 
# **Action:** This markdown cell synthesizes the insights from Cells 1 through 18 into a definitive list.
# 
# ---
# 
# Based on the comprehensive analysis of the optimal offloading dataset, we have uncovered the following key findings:
# 
# *   **Finding 1: The Optimal Policy is Highly Dynamic and User-Specific.**
#     *   The wireless environment (`input_h`) is extremely volatile, with channel conditions changing rapidly.
#     *   Optimal offloading frequencies vary drastically between users (from over 60% for User 0 to under 6% for User 9), proving that a one-size-fits-all strategy is ineffective.
# 
# *   **Finding 2: The Offloading Decision is Fundamentally Tied to Channel Quality.**
#     *   There is a clear, strong positive correlation between a user's channel gain and the optimal decision to offload. Users consistently offload only when their signal quality is high. This was validated visually (box plots, time-series overlay) and numerically (correlation heatmap).
# 
# *   **Finding 3: System Performance is a Function of Collective User Behavior.**
#     *   The overall computation rate (`Q_optimal`) is strongly and positively correlated with both the number of users offloading and the average system-wide channel quality. Better collective channel conditions lead to higher potential performance.
# 
# *   **Finding 4: Resource Allocation is a Balancing Act.**
#     *   The server's energy broadcasting time (`a_time`) and the task offloading times (`tau`) vary, suggesting the optimal policy must constantly balance between providing energy for local computation and allocating time for data transmission.
# 
# *   **Finding 5: The Dataset Provides a Clear Performance Benchmark.**
#     *   The optimal computation rate (`Q_optimal`) has a well-defined, though skewed, distribution. The average optimal performance is approximately **3.18 million**, which provides a concrete target for our DRL agent to strive for.

# %% [markdown]
# ### **Cell 20: Implications for DRL Agent Design**
# 
# **Purpose:** To explicitly connect the findings from this EDA to the next phase of the project: designing and building the Deep Reinforcement Learning (DROO) agent.
# 
# **Action:** This summary outlines how our data-driven insights will translate into specific design choices for the agent's state, reward, and evaluation.
# 
# ---
# 
# The insights gathered in this notebook provide a solid, evidence-based foundation for designing the DROO agent. The following design choices are directly informed by our analysis:
# 
# 1.  **State Representation (The Agent's "Senses"):**
#     *   **Must Include:** The agent's input state **must** include the current channel gain (`h`) for each user. Our analysis shows this is the single most important factor in making an optimal decision.
#     *   **Structure:** An input vector containing `[h_user_0, h_user_1, ..., h_user_9]` is a logical starting point, as user channels are largely independent.
# 
# 2.  **Action Space (The Agent's "Choices"):**
#     *   **Definition:** The agent's action for each user will be a discrete choice between two options: `0` (Local Processing) and `1` (Offload), directly mirroring the `output_mode` data.
# 
# 3.  **Reward Function (The Agent's "Motivation"):**
#     *   **Primary Goal:** The reward function should be directly based on the **weighted sum computation rate**. The goal is to train the agent to take actions that maximize this value, thereby learning a policy that approximates the `Q_optimal` distribution we analyzed.
#     *   **Structure:** A simple and effective reward at each time step could be the computation rate achieved in that step.
# 
# 4.  **Evaluation and Benchmarking (How We Measure "Success"):**
#     *   **Primary Benchmark:** The average optimal performance of **~3.18 million** will serve as the "oracle" or upper-bound benchmark. A successful agent will be one whose average achieved computation rate gets as close as possible to this value.
#     *   **Behavioral Check:** We can also compare the agent's learned offloading frequency per user to the optimal frequencies found in Cell 10. If the agent learns to offload frequently for Users 0/1 and rarely for Users 8/9, it is a strong sign that it has captured the underlying dynamics of the problem.
# 
# This concludes the data preparation and visualization phase. We now have a clear, data-backed plan for developing an intelligent agent to solve the online offloading problem.

# # **02: Training the DROO Agent with Memory-Augmented DNN**
# 
# ### **Objective**
# 
# This notebook marks the core of the DROO project: **training the Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent**. We will use the `MemoryDNN` agent, which is designed to learn an optimal offloading policy from the data we prepared in the previous notebook.
# 
# The goal is to train the agent over a series of time frames, allowing it to learn the complex relationship between wireless channel conditions and the optimal offloading decisions.
# 
# ### **Notebook Workflow**
# 
# 1.  **Setup:** Import necessary libraries and define helper functions for plotting and saving results.
# 2.  **Configuration:** Define the key parameters for our training experiment, such as the number of users and the agent's memory size.
# 3.  **Data Loading:** Load the pre-processed dataset containing channel gains and the "oracle's" optimal performance rates.
# 4.  **Model Initialization:** Create an instance of our `MemoryDNN` agent with a specific neural network architecture.
# 5.  **Training Loop:** Run the main training simulation, where the agent makes decisions, receives feedback (by calculating the computation rate), and updates its internal neural network.
# 6.  **Performance Analysis:** Visualize the agent's learning progress by plotting its training cost and its performance relative to the oracle.
# 7.  **Saving Results:** Save the trained model and all relevant performance metrics for future analysis and deployment.

# # **03: DROO Agent - Evaluation and Live Demonstration**
# 
# ### **Objective**
# 
# This notebook serves as the final evaluation and demonstration platform for our pre-trained **Deep Reinforcement Learning for Online Offloading (DROO)** agent. Having successfully trained the `MemoryDNN` agent in the previous notebook, our goal here is to test its generalization capabilities under dynamic network conditions that it has not seen during training.
# 
# ### **Evaluation Scenarios**
# 
# We will subject the agent to two challenging, real-world scenarios:
# 
# 1.  **Demo 1: Alternating User Weights:** We will dynamically change the importance (weights) of different users during the simulation. This tests the agent's **adaptability** to changing network priorities.
# 2.  **Demo 2: WDs Turning On/Off:** We will simulate users joining and leaving the network by turning their devices on and off. This tests the agent's **robustness** to a changing state and action space size.
# 
# The agent will **not be trained** in this notebook. We are purely in evaluation mode, observing how well the learned policy performs on these new challenges.

# ## **Demo 1: Adaptability to Changing User Weights**
# 
# In this scenario, we test the agent's ability to adapt to shifting priorities in the network. User weights determine how much their individual performance contributes to the overall system computation rate.
# 
# **Scenario Workflow:**
# 1.  **Frames 0 - 5999:** Users have their original weights.
# 2.  **Frames 6000 - 7999:** The weights for odd and even users are swapped, changing their importance.
# 3.  **Frames 8000 - 9999:** The weights are reverted to the original configuration.
# 
# A successful agent should maintain a high performance ratio close to 1.0, even when these priorities change unexpectedly.

# ### **Analysis of Demo 1: High Adaptability**
# 
# The plot shows the agent's performance relative to the oracle.
# 
# -   **Stable Performance:** In the initial phase (frames 0-6000), the agent consistently achieves **over 95%** of the optimal performance, demonstrating its effectiveness under the conditions it was trained on.
# -   **Adaptation to Change:** When the user weights are swapped at frame 6000, there is a **minor, brief dip** in performance. However, the agent quickly adapts. Because the agent's decisions are based on maximizing the computation rate‚Äîwhich is calculated using the *new* weights‚Äîits policy remains effective.
# -   **Robustness:** The agent proves it is not just memorizing patterns but has learned a robust strategy of generating good candidate solutions and selecting the one that best fits the current network objectives (weights).

# This scenario tests the agent's ability to handle a dynamic number of active users, a common occurrence in real wireless networks.
# 
# **Scenario Workflow:**
# 1.  **Frames 0 - 5999:** All 10 users are active.
# 2.  **Frames 6000 - 7999:** Users are progressively turned OFF, reducing the number of active devices from 10 down to 6.
# 3.  **Frames 8000 - 9999:** Users are turned back ON, restoring the network to its full size.

# ### **Analysis of Demo 2: High Robustness**
# 
# This plot shows the agent's performance as the number of active users changes.
# 
# -   **Consistent Performance:** The agent maintains its high performance (>95% of oracle) even as users are turned off and on.
# -   **No Retraining Needed:** Crucially, the agent's underlying neural network was trained for a 10-user system and was never retrained. By simulating an "off" user with a near-zero channel gain, the agent naturally learns to ignore it (i.e., it decides to compute locally for that user).
# -   **Robust Strategy:** This demonstrates that the learned policy is robust and can handle a dynamic number of participants without needing to be fundamentally changed. The agent has successfully learned a generalizable strategy rather than a fixed one.

# %% [markdown]
# # **Overall Conclusion**
# 
# Across both demanding evaluation scenarios, the pre-trained **MemoryDNN agent demonstrated exceptional performance**:
# 
# 1.  **High-Fidelity Policy:** The agent consistently achieved over **95% of the theoretical maximum performance** calculated by the non-real-time "oracle" optimizer.
# 
# 2.  **Adaptability:** It successfully adapted to changes in network priorities (user weights) with minimal performance degradation, showcasing its ability to optimize for a changing objective.
# 
# 3.  **Robustness:** It handled a dynamic number of active users gracefully without any retraining, proving that its learned policy is generalizable and not brittle.
# 
# This evaluation confirms that the DROO agent has learned an effective and robust policy for making real-time offloading decisions in a complex and dynamic wireless environment.
